### Hey there! 👋 I'm Gustavo

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Senior Fullstack Engineer** currently working at **Grupo Boticário** 🧴💻. I spend my days building scalable, high-performance applications and wrangling data pipelines with some amazing technologies like:

- **Node.js** 🟢 & **TypeScript** 💻 (My bread and butter for backend and frontend magic)
- **Serverless Functions** ☁️ (Deploying with ease and scalability in mind)
- **AWS & Google Cloud** ☁️ (Leveraging cloud power for building microservices, event-driven systems, and more)
- **BigQuery** 📊 (For handling massive datasets and insights extraction)

#### What I do:
- Architect and implement **Microservices** with a focus on high availability, performance, and clean design.
- Build **Event-Driven Applications** leveraging the power of message queues and event sourcing.
- Apply **SOLID Principles** and **Clean Architecture** to ensure code is not just functional but also maintainable and scalable.
- Design and implement **Data Pipelines**, making sure data flows smoothly from collection to analysis.

I'm passionate about finding the sweet spot between **developer experience** and **performance**, always aiming for elegant solutions that are both **simple** and **powerful**.

#### A bit more about me 🎵✈️
When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me on an adventure somewhere new – I love to **travel** and explore different cultures. 🌍 I'm also a big fan of **music** 🎶, and every now and then I risk picking up my **guitar** or **tambourine** for a jam session (with varying degrees of success 😄).
